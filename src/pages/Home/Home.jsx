          The new release of Debian includes significantly more software than its predecessor, Bullseye, with over 11,089 new packages, bringing the total to over 64,419 packages. More than 43,254 packages have been updated, which accounts for 67% of all packages in Bullseye. Additionally, over 6,296 packages (10% of those in Bullseye) have been removed for various reasons, and these will be marked as "obsolete" in package management front-ends.        </p>
